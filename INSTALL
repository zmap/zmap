ZMap is designed to run on GNU/Linux systems and can be built with
most recent versions of gcc.  ZMap requires GMP, a free library for
arbitrary precision arithmetic, gengetopt, and libpcap.   Currently
ZMap only supports 64-bit systems.

These packages can be installed on Debian-based systems by running:

  sudo apt-get install libgmp3-dev gengetopt libpcap-dev
 
or on RHEL- and Fedora-based systems by running:

  sudo yum install gmp gmp-devel gengetopt libpcap-devel

Once these prerequisites have been installed, ZMap can be installed by running:

  cd src
  make

followed by:

  sudo make install

Redis support is not enabled by default.  If you are want to use ZMap
with Redis, you will first need to install Hiredis.  Then, rebuild
ZMap with the command "make REDIS=true".

JSON support is not enabled by default.  If you are want to use ZMap
with JSON output, you will first need to install json-c.  Then, rebuild
ZMap with the command "make JSON=true".

Installing json-c requires git and autotools to be available. For more
information on how to install json-c, please see http://github.com/json-c/json-c
