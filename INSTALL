SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

ZMap is designed to run on GNU/Linux systems and can be built with
most recent versions of gcc.  Currently, ZMap only supports 64-bit
systems.  Running it requires at least 600 MB of free memory.

BUILDING AND INSTALLING ZMAP

ZMap requires GMP, a free library for arbitrary precision arithmetic,
gengetopt, and libpcap.  These packages can be installed on
Debian-based systems by running:

  sudo apt-get install libgmp3-dev gengetopt libpcap-dev

or on RHEL- and Fedora-based systems by running:

  sudo yum install gmp gmp-devel gengetopt libpcap-devel

Once these prerequisites have been installed, ZMap can be installed
 by running:

  cd src
  make

followed by:

  sudo make install

Redis support is not enabled by default.  If you are want to use ZMap
with Redis, you will first need to install Hiredis.  Then, rebuild
ZMap with the command "make REDIS=true".

JSON support is not enabled by default.  If you are want to use ZMap
with JSON output, you will first need to install json-c.  Then, rebuild
ZMap with the command "make JSON=true".

Installing json-c requires git and autotools to be available. For more
information on how to install json-c, please see http://github.com/json-c/json-c
