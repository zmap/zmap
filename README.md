ZMap: The Internet Scanner
==========================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/zmap/zmap.svg?branch=travis-configuration)](https://travis-ci.org/zmap/zmap)

ZMap is a fast single packet network scanner designed for Internet-wide network
surveys. On a typical desktop computer with a gigabit Ethernet connection, ZMap
is capable scanning the entire public IPv4 address space in under 45 minutes.
With a 10gigE connection and PF_RING, ZMap can scan the IPv4 address space in
under 5 minutes.

ZMap operates on GNU/Linux, Mac OS, and BSD. ZMap currently has fully
implemented probe modules for TCP SYN scans, ICMP, DNS queries, UPnP, BACNET,
and can send a large number of UDP probes. If you are looking to do more
involved scans, e.g., banner grab or TLS handshake, take a look at ZGrab
(https://github.com/zmap/zgrab), ZMap's sister project that does
application-layer handshakes.
