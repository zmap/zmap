[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/zmap/zmap.svg?branch=travis-configuration)](https://travis-ci.org/zmap/zmap)

ZMap is a fast network scanner designed for Internet-wide network surveys. On a
typical desktop computer with a gigabit Ethernet connection, ZMap is capable
scanning the entire public IPv4 address space in under 45 minutes. With a 10gigE
connection and PF_RING, ZMap can scan the IPv4 address space in under 5 minutes.

While previous network tools have been designed to scan small network segments,
ZMap is specifically architected to scan the entire address space.  It is built
in a modular manner in order to allow incorporation with other network survey
tools.  ZMap operates on GNU/Linux and supports TCP SYN and ICMP echo request
scanning out of the box.

Documentation and examples can be found at https://zmap.io/.
