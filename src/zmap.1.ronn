zmap(1) - The Fast Internet Scanner
===================================

## SYNOPSIS

zmap [ -p &lt;port> ] [ -o &lt;outfile&gt; ] [ OPTIONS... ] [ ip/hostname/range ]

## DESCRIPTION

*ZMap* is a network tool for scanning the entire IPv4 address space (or large
samples).  ZMap is capable of scanning the entire Internet in around 45 minutes
on a gigabit network connection, reaching ~98% theoretical line speed.

## OPTIONS

### BASIC OPTIONS ###

   * `ip`/`hostname`/`range`:
     IP addresses or DNS hostnames to scan. Accepts IP ranges in CIDR block
     notation. Defaults to 0.0.0/8

   * `-p`, `--target-port=port`:
     TCP or UDP port number to scan (for SYN scans and basic UDP scans)

   * `-o`, `--output-file=name`:
     When using an output module that uses a file, write results to this file.
     Use - for stdout.

   * `-b`, `--blocklist-file=path`:
     File of subnets to exclude, in CIDR notation, one-per line. It is
     recommended you use this to exclude RFC 1918 addresses, multicast, IANA
     reserved space, and other IANA special-purpose addresses. An example
     blocklist file **blocklist.conf** for this purpose.

   * `-w`, `--allowlist-file=path`:
	File of subnets to scan, in CIDR notation, one-per line. Specifying a
	allowlist file is equivalent to specifying to ranges directly on the command
    line interface, but allows specifying a large number of subnets. Note:
	if you are specifying a large number of individual IP addresses (more than
	10 million), you should instead use `--list-of-ips-file`.

   * `-I`, `--list-of-ips-file=path`:
	File of individual IP addresses to scan, one-per line. This feature allows you
	to scan a large number of unrelated addresses. If you have a small number of IPs,
	it is faster to specify these on the command
	line or by using `--allowlist-file`. This should only be used when scanning more than
	10 million addresses. When used in with --allowlist-path, only hosts in the intersection
	of both sets will be scanned. Hosts specified here, but included in the blocklist will
	be excluded.

### SCAN OPTIONS ###

   * `-r`, `--rate=pps`:
     Set the send rate in packets/sec. Note: when combined with --probes,  this is
     total packets per second, not IPs per second. Setting the rate to 0 will scan
     at full line rate. Default: 10000 pps.

   * `-B`, `--bandwidth=bps`:
     Set the send rate in bits/second (supports suffixes G, M, and K (e.g. -B
     10M for 10 mbps). This overrides the --rate flag.

   * `-n`, `--max-targets=n`:
     Cap the number of targets to probe. This can either be a number (e.g. -n
     1000) or a percentage (e.g. -n 0.1%) of the scannable address space
     (after excluding blocklist)

   * `-N`, `--max-results=n`:
     Exit after receiving this many results

   * `-t`, `--max-runtime=secs`:
     Cap the length of time for sending packets

   * `-c`, `--cooldown-time=secs`:
     How long to continue receiving after sending has completed (default=8)

   * `-e`, `--seed=n`:
     Seed used to select address permutation. Use this if you want to scan
     addresses in the same order for multiple ZMap runs.

   * `-P`, `--probes=n`:
     Number of probes to send to each IP (default=1)

   * `--retries=n`:
     Number of times to try resending a packet if the sendto call fails (default=10)

   * `--batch=n`:
     Number of packets to send in a burst between checks to the ratelimit. A
     batch size above 1 allows the sleep-based rate-limiter to be used with
     proportionally higher rates. This can reduce CPU usage, in exchange for a
     bursty send rate. (default=1)

### SCAN SHARDING ###

   * `--shards=N`:
     Split the scan up into N shards/partitions among different instances of
     zmap (default=1). When sharding, **--seed** is required.

   * `--shard=n`:
     Set which shard to scan (default=0). Shards are 0-indexed in the range
     [0, N), where N is the    total number of shards. When sharding
     **--seed** is required.

### NETWORK OPTIONS ###

   * `-s`, `--source-port=port|range`:
     Source port(s) to send packets from

   * `-S`, `--source-ip=ip|range`:
     Source address(es) to send packets from. Either single IP or range (e.g.
     10.0.0.1-10.0.0.9)

   * `-G`, `--gateway-mac=addr`:
     Gateway MAC address to send packets to (in case auto-detection fails)

   * `--source-mac=addr`:
     Source MAC address to send packets from (in case auto-detection fails)

   * `-i`, `--interface=name`:
     Network interface to use

   * `-X`, `--iplayer`:
     Send IP layer packets instead of ethernet packets (for non-Ethernet interface)

### PROBE OPTIONS ###

ZMap allows users to specify and write their own probe modules. Probe modules
are responsible for generating probe packets to send, and processing responses
from hosts.

   * `--list-probe-modules`:
     List available probe modules (e.g. tcp_synscan)

   * `-M`, `--probe-module=name`:
     Select probe module (default=tcp_synscan)

   * `--probe-args=args`:
     Arguments to pass to probe module

   * `--probe-ttl=hops`:
     Set TTL value for probe IP packets

   * `--list-output-fields`:
     List the fields the selected probe module can send to the output module

### OUTPUT OPTIONS ###

ZMap allows users to specify and write their own output modules for use with
ZMap. Output modules are responsible for processing the fieldsets returned by
the probe module, and outputting them to the user. Users can specify output
fields, and write filters over the output fields.

   * `--list-output-modules`:
     List available output modules (e.g. csv)

   * `-O`, `--output-module=name`:
     Select output module (default=csv)

   * `--output-args=args`:
     Arguments to pass to output module

   * `-f`, `--output-fields=fields`:
     Comma-separated list of fields to output

   * `--output-filter`:
     Specify an output filter over the fields defined by the probe module. See
     the output filter section for more details.

   * `--no-header-row`:
     Excludes any header rows (e.g., CSV header fields) from ZMap output. This is
     useful if you're piping results into another application that expects only
     data.

### LOGGING AND METADATA OPTIONS ###

   * `-q`, `--quiet`:
     Do not print status updates once per second

   * `-v`, `--verbosity=n`:
     Level of log detail (0-5, default=3)

   * `-l`, `--log-file=filename`:
	 Output file for log messages. By default, stderr.

   * `-m`, `--metadata-file=filename`:
     Output file for scan metadata (JSON)

   * `-L`, `--log-directory`:
     Write log entries to a timestamped file in this directory

   * `-u`, `--status-updates-file`:
     Write scan progress updates to CSV file"

   * `--disable-syslog`:
     Disables logging messages to syslog

   * `--notes`:
     Inject user-specified notes into scan metadata

   * `--user-metadata`:
     Inject user-specified JSON metadata into scan metadata

### ADDITIONAL OPTIONS ###

   * `-T`, `--sender-threads=n`:
     Threads used to send packets. ZMap will attempt to detect the optimal
     number of send threads based on the number of processor cores.

   * `-C`, `--config=filename`:
     Read a configuration file, which can specify any other options.

   * `-d`, `--dryrun`:
     Print out each packet to stdout instead of sending it (useful for
     debugging)

   * `--max-sendto-failures`:
     Maximum NIC sendto failures before scan is aborted

   * `--min-hitrate`:
     Minimum hitrate that scan can hit before scan is aborted

   * `--cores`:
     Comma-separated list of cores to pin to

   * `--ignore-blocklist-errors`:
      Ignore invalid, malformed, or unresolvable entries in allowlist/blocklist file.
      Replaces the pre-v3.x `--ignore-invalid-hosts` option.

   * `-h`, `--help`:
     Print help and exit

   * `-V`, `--version`:
     Print version and exit

### OUTPUT FILTERS ###

Results generated by a probe module can be filtered before being passed to the
output module. Filters are defined over the output fields of a probe module.
Filters are written in a simple filtering language, similar to SQL, and are
passed to ZMap using the `--output-filter` option. Output filters are commonly
used to filter out duplicate results, or to only pass only successful responses
to the output module.

Filter expressions are of the form `<fieldname> <operation> <value>`. The type of
`<value>` must be either a string or unsigned integer literal, and match the type
of `<fieldname>`. The valid operations for integer comparisons are = !=, <, >,
<=, >=. The operations for string comparisons are =, !=. The
`--list-output-fields` flag will print what fields and types are available for
the selected probe module, and then exit.

Compound filter expressions may be constructed by combining filter expressions
using parenthesis to specify order of operations, the && (logical AND) and ||
(logical OR) operators.

For example, a filter for only successful, non-duplicate responses would be
written as: `--output-filter="success = 1 && repeat = 0"`

### UDP PROBE MODULE OPTIONS ###

These arguments are all passed using the `--probe-args=args` option. Only one
argument may be passed at a time.

   * `file:/path/to/file`:
     Path to payload file to send to each host over UDP.

   * `template:/path/to/template`:
     Path to template file. For each destination host, the template file is
     populated, set as the UDP payload, and sent.

   * `text:<text>`:
     ASCII text to send to each destination host

   * `hex:<hex>`:
    Hex-encoded binary to send to each destination host

   * `template-fields`:
     Print information about the allowed template fields and exit.

### MID-SCAN CHANGES ###

You can change the rate at which ZMap is scanning mid-scan by sending SIGUSR1 (increase)
and SIGUSR2 (decrease) signals to ZMap. These will result in the scan rate increasing or
decreasing by 5%.
