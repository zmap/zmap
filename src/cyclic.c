/*
 * cyclic provides an inexpensive approach to iterating over the IPv4 address
 * space in a random(-ish) manner such that we connect to every host once in
 * a scan execution without having to keep track of the IPs that have been
 * scanned or need to be scanned and such that each scan has a different
 * ordering. We accomplish this by utilizing a cyclic multiplicative group
 * of integers modulo a prime and generating a new primitive root (generator)
 * for each scan.
 *
 * We know that 3 is a generator of (Z mod 2^32 + 15 - {0}, *)
 * and that we have coverage over the entire address space because 2**32 + 15
 * is prime and ||(Z mod PRIME - {0}, *)|| == PRIME - 1. Therefore, we
 * just need to find a new generator (primitive root) of the cyclic group for
 * each scan that we perform.
 *
 * Because generators map to generators over an isomorphism, we can efficiently
 * find random primitive roots of our mult. group by finding random generators
 * of the group (Zp-1, +) which is isomorphic to (Zp*, *). Specifically the
 * generators of (Zp-1, +) are { s | (s, p-1) == 1 } which implies that
 * the generators of (Zp*, *) are { d^s | (s, p-1) == 1 }. where d is a known
 * generator of the multiplicative group. We efficiently find
 * generators of the additive group by precalculating the psub1_f of
 * p - 1 and randomly checking random numbers against the psub1_f until
 * we find one that is coprime and map it into Zp*. Because
 * totient(totient(p)) ~= 10^9, this should take relatively few
 * iterations to find a new generator.
