## Installing/Building ZMap

### Installing from Package Manager

ZMap operates on GNU/Linux, Mac OS, and BSD. The latest stable version (v2.1.1)
can be installed using most OS package managers:

Fedora 19+ or EPEL 6+:
  ```sh
  yum install zmap
  ```

Debian 8+, Ubuntu 14.04+:
  ```sh
  sudo apt install zmap
  ```

Arch Linux:
  ```sh
  pacman -S zmap
  ```

Gentoo:
  ```sh
  sudo emerge zmap
  ```

Mac OS (brew):
  ```sh
  brew install zmap
  ```

### Building from Source

It is also possible to build ZMap from source.

#### Installing ZMap Dependencies

ZMap has the following dependencies:

  - [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/) - Cross-platform, open-source build system
  - [GMP](http://gmplib.org/) - Free library for arbitrary precision arithmetic
  - [gengetopt](http://www.gnu.org/software/gengetopt/gengetopt.html) - Command line option parsing for C programs
  - [libpcap](http://www.tcpdump.org/) - Famous user-level packet capture library
  - [flex](http://flex.sourceforge.net/) and [byacc](http://invisible-island.net/byacc/) - Output filter lexer and parser generator.
  - [json-c](https://github.com/json-c/json-c/) - JSON implementation in C
  - [libunistring](https://www.gnu.org/software/libunistring/) - Unicode string library for C
  - [libdnet](https://github.com/dugsong/libdnet) - (Mac Only) Gateway and route detection.

In addition, you can get following packages to get further functionalities:

  - [hiredis](https://github.com/redis/hiredis) - RedisDB support in C
  - [mongo-c-driver](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-c-driver/) - MongoDB support in C

You can install these dependencies with the following commands

* On Debian-based systems by running:
   ```sh
   sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake libgmp3-dev gengetopt libpcap-dev flex byacc libjson-c-dev pkg-config libunistring-dev
   ```

* On RHEL- and Fedora-based systems by running:
   ```sh
   sudo yum install cmake gmp-devel gengetopt libpcap-devel flex byacc json-c-devel libunistring-devel
   ```

* On Mac OS systems using [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/):
  ```sh
  brew install pkg-config cmake gmp gengetopt json-c byacc libdnet libunistring
  ```

#### Building and Installing ZMap

Once these prerequisites have been installed, ZMap can be compiled
by running:
  ```sh
  cmake .
  make -j4
  ```

and installed by running:
  ```sh
  sudo make install
  ```

## Miscellaneous Notes

- Enabling development turns on debug symbols, and turns off optimizations.
Release builds should be built with `-DENABLE_DEVELOPMENT=OFF`.

- Enabling `log_trace`:w can have a major performance impact and should not be used
except during early development. Release builds should be built with `-DENABLE_LOG_TRACE=OFF`.

- Redis support is not enabled by default. If you want to use ZMap with Redis, you will first need to install hiredis. Then run cmake with `-DWITH_REDIS=ON`. Debian has packaged it as `libhiredis-dev`, Fedora and RHEL have packaged it as `hiredis-devel`.

- MongoDB support is not enabled by default. If you want to use ZMap with MongoDB, you will first need to install mongo-c-driver. Then run cmake with `-DWITH_MONGO=ON`.

- Building packages for some systems like Fedora and RHEL requires a user-definable directory (buildroot) to put files, the conducive way to respect prefix is to run cmake with `-DRESPECT_INSTALL_PREFIX_CONFIG=ON`.

- Manpages (and their HTML representations) are generated from the `.ronn` source files in the repository, using the [ronn](https://github.com/rtomayko/ronn) tool. This does not happen automatically as part of the build process; to regenerate the man pages you'll need to run `make manpages`. This target assumes that `ronn` is in your PATH.

- Building with some versions of CMake may fail with `unable to find parser.h`. If this happens, try updating CMake. If it still fails, don't clone ZMap into a path that contains the string `.com`, and try again.

- ZMap may be installed to an alternative directory, with the `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` option. For example, run
    ```
    cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/opt .
    make -j4
    make install
    ```
